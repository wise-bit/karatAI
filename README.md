*We are Team Cocoa*

KaratAI is a webapp designed for people to practice and perfect their Karate skills at home. With COVID-19 leaving everyone quarantined, there aren't many ways to learn physical skills such as martial arts at home. KaratAI aims to destroy these boundaries. Simply put, you can practice and learn Karate moves in front of your webcam and our webapp will grade how you did. Using our unique algorithm OpenPose, Machine Learning, and the OpenCV library, we use image recognition to detect pivot points and compare it to a wireframe and grades it based on the accuracy of the form. Over time, you will get better at your karate moves and be on your way to becoming a black belt!
